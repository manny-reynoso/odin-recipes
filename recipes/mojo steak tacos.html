        <h4>Steps to make</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Add the garlic, onion, cilantro, jalapenos and fresh oregano (if using) to your food processor and pulse until very finely chopped, scraping the sides down as needed. Transfer to a large freezer bag and stir in all remaining marinade ingredients. Reserve ⅓ cup marinade to toss with chopped steak after it’s cooked. Add steak, squeeze out excess air, seal and turn to evenly coat. Marinate in the refrigerator 4-12 hours (the longer the better).</li>
                <li>While the steak is marinating, prepare avocado crema and pineapple mango salsa. Salsa is best made one hour before serving or you can prep the ingredients earlier and combine one hour before serving. (Click on “Avocado Crema” and Pineapple Mango Salsa” in the ingredients for the recipes.)</li>
                <li>Remove steak from the refrigerator and let it rest for 30-60 minutes before cooking.</li>
                <li>Grease and preheat outdoor grill (or indoor grill pan) to high heat. Once hot, add steak and turn down to medium-high. Grill steak for 5-6 minutes per side, or until an internal thermometer reads 130-135 degrees F for medium rare or around 140 degrees for medium. Grill time will vary depending on thickness of your steak and desired level of doneness.</li>
                <li>Remove steak and let rest 10 minutes before chopping into small pieces. Toss with reserved ⅓ cup marinade.</li>
                <li>Warm tortillas in the microwave, in a skillet or char on the grill or open gas stovetop flame until warm but still pliable (detailed instructions in notes).</li>
                <li>Assemble steak tacos by layering warmed corn tortillas with chopped steak, pineapple mango salsa, avocado crema and cotija. Season with freshly cracked salt to taste and serve with optional lime wedges and hot sauce.</li>
            </ol>
